# Task tracking console application
The task tracking console application is designed to help users track and manage their tasks efficiently. It provides functionality to view, add, edit, mark tasks as completed, delete tasks, and identify overdue tasks. The application operates in a non-interactive mode, where the user initiates the application and receives immediate results without further input.
